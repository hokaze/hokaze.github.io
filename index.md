If you like something I've made and want to support my continued existence, feel free to [buy me a drink](https://www.paypal.me/hokaze/1) or maybe even [buy me a pizza](https://www.paypal.me/hokaze/5).  
  
Not saying either of those will _guarantee_ I'll keep making stuff you like or implement a feature you want, but they certainly help ;)  
    
    
## Some things I've made  
  
### [Process ID 90001](https://github.com/hokaze/Process-ID-9001)  
A [WIP game](https://hokaze.itch.io/process-id-9001) and first foray into [Twine](https://twinery.org/) about an accidental AI trying to evolve and survive.  
  
### [Resplendent Exalted Dice Roller](https://github.com/hokaze/Resplendent-Exalted-Dice-Roller)  
A [dice roller for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hokaze.exaltedroller) aimed at Exalted, World of Darkness and other Storyteller/Storytelling system tabletop RPGs. Primarily aimed at Exalted 2nd and 3rd editions.  
  
### [Pathfinder Background Generator](https://github.com/hokaze/Pathfinder-Background-Generator)  
An [Android App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hokaze.pathfinderbackgroundgenerator) that automates the many random tables of Pathfinder Ultimate Campaign's random background generator.  
  
### [tkinter-png](https://github.com/hokaze/tkinter-png)  
An old set of hacks allowing for png support in tkinter purely through python modules. Also adds a few extensions to the PhotoImage class present in tcl/tk but missing in the normal python bindings.  
Useful if you don't have permissions to install PIL, Pillow or another major image library.
